in neutral language is the <unk> of mr. mason 's remarks quoted first in the village voice while he was a paid spokesman for the rudolph giuliani mayoral campaign and then in newsweek after he and the campaign <unk> company  <unk> 
mason said that many jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks so they support black candidates <unk>  <unk> 
said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination so they too support black candidates <unk>  <unk> 
said that <unk> have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice <unk>  <unk> 
course mr. mason did not use neutral language  <unk> 
a <unk> of ethnic humor from the old days on the <unk> belt live television and the <unk> circuit mr. mason <unk> reached for the <unk>  <unk> 
said <unk> were sick with <unk> and he called david dinkins mr. giuliani 's black opponent a fancy <unk> with a <unk>  <unk> 
mr. mason had used less <unk> language to <unk> his <unk> analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow new <unk> would the water be quite so hot  <unk> 
probably would because few or none of the people upset by mr. mason 's remarks have bothered to <unk> between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used <unk> language  <unk> 
addition some of mr. mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of <unk>  <unk> 
example the new york state counsel for the <unk> said that mr. mason is like a <unk>  <unk> 
are fast leaving the place where he is stuck  <unk> 
critics fail to <unk> between the type of ethnic humor that aims at <unk> another group such as polish jokes and the type that is <unk> aiming <unk> as well as <unk>  <unk> 
latter typically is the humor of the <unk> and it was <unk> by both blacks and <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> stage as a means of <unk> their white and <unk> audiences along with themselves  <unk> 
the hands of a <unk> like <unk> bruce this <unk> <unk> could cut both the <unk> and the audience to <unk>  <unk>

despite all the media <unk> about comedy and politics not <unk> they are similar in one respect both can serve as <unk> for easing <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of groups in conflict  <unk>

elizabeth <unk> wrote in the new york times just before the mason <unk> perhaps <unk> would not <unk> over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to <unk>  <unk> 
question is if group conflicts still exist as <unk> they do and if mr. mason 's type of ethnic humor is <unk> then what other means do we have for letting off steam  <unk> 
n't say the tv <unk> because that happens to be a <unk> that in its desperate need to attract everybody and <unk> nobody resembles politics more than it does comedy  <unk> 
is true that the best <unk> do allow group differences to <unk> <unk> vs. blue-collar <unk> in <unk> children vs. adults in the cosby show  <unk>

a safe one imagine if the <unk> in question were between an orthodox <unk> and a member of the nation of <unk>  <unk>

it has remained there as <unk> by its <unk> in a N cbs <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> whose sole <unk> was that it led to the <unk> marriage of meredith <unk> and david <unk>  <unk> 
the question with chicken soup is not whether the pot will <unk> over but whether it will <unk> at all  <unk> 
far the <unk> have been few and far between  <unk> 
of the problem is the tendency of all <unk> ever since the <unk> days of norman <unk> to <unk> about social issues  <unk> 
some extent this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to <unk> us about ethnic <unk> by <unk> them  <unk> 
instance michael <unk> <unk> not because he 's a <unk> jewish businessman but because he <unk> his <unk> job as a salesman in order to become a social worker  <unk> 
more <unk> is the <unk> between <unk> <unk> and mr. mason 's comic <unk>  <unk> 
best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end and occasionally in the middle when mr. mason <unk> into his <unk> mode and starts <unk> out that old-fashioned jewish <unk> to other people as well as to himself  <unk> 
too often these <unk> lack spark because this <unk> like all <unk> is <unk> about <unk> mr. mason 's stock in trade ethnic differences  <unk> 
'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the <unk> dispute over the <unk> <unk> at <unk>  <unk>

see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion he says  <unk> 
explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has <unk> a lot of <unk> securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the <unk> of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity  <unk> 
has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable  <unk> 
he says a depression does n't appear likely  <unk> 
is more <unk> in the economy at large than we commonly <unk> he says  <unk> 
takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the <unk> much as the financial community and the government may try  <unk>

are ford looking at jaguar bellsouth looking at lin broadcasting  <unk>

you could n't sell dollars he says  <unk> 
would give you a quote but then refuse to make the trade  <unk> 
the dollar stays weak he says that will add to <unk> pressures in the u.s. and make it hard for the federal reserve board to ease interest rates very much  <unk> 
rogers wo n't decide what to do today until he sees how the london and tokyo markets go  <unk>

people now claim to have predicted the N crash  <unk> 
newsletter writer francis <unk> <unk> actually did it he stated in writing in september N that the dow jones industrial average was likely to decline about N points the following month  <unk>

it promptly cuts the discount rate it charges on loans to banks he says that could quiet things down  <unk> 
not we could go to N very soon  <unk> 
w. <unk>  <unk> 
prices would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks says mr. <unk> president and managing director of renaissance investment management inc. in cincinnati  <unk> 
which manages about $ N billion drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally  <unk> 
is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents primarily u.s. treasury bills  <unk> 
probably are the right place to be he says  <unk> 
the oct. N letter to the editor from rep. tom <unk> chairman of the house subcommittee on employment and housing alleging  <unk> 
that your sept. N editorial <unk> committees was <unk> inaccurate and deliberately misleading  <unk> 
thought your editorial was <unk> accurate and deliberately <unk>  <unk> 
that mr. <unk> supported the rights of the witnesses to take the fifth amendment  <unk> 
he did  <unk> 
i watched him on <unk> i heard him speak those lovely words about the bill of rights which he quotes from the <unk> of the hearings  <unk> 
did repeat those nice <unk> several times as an indication of his support for the constitution  <unk> 
used about N words defending the witnesses ' constitutional rights  <unk> 
by my rough guess he used better than N words <unk> <unk> on the witnesses for exercising the fifth  <unk> 
<unk> his <unk> of constitutional meat between large <unk> of <unk> commentary  <unk> 
your editorial <unk> pointed out samuel <unk> former hud secretary and <unk> wilson mr. <unk> 's former aide are currently being held up to <unk> for taking the fifth amendment  <unk> 
certainly is not the supposed distorted reading indicated by mr. <unk>  <unk> 
that his committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at hud  <unk> 
colleagues and i fully realize we are not a court etc  <unk> 
<unk>  <unk> 
any reasonable man <unk> mr. <unk> and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted  <unk> 
their verdict is in  <unk> 
now they 're pursuing evidence  <unk> 
's not a bad way to proceed just somewhat different from standard american practice  <unk> 
was that practice referred to when i was in school  <unk> 
yes something called a star chamber  <unk> 
course mr. <unk> <unk> protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change  <unk> 
doubt that 's partially true  <unk> 
that mr. <unk> says in his letter is partially true  <unk> 
's right about his subcommittee 's responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior hud officials  <unk> 
if his explanation of <unk> is true why is his investigation so <unk> as to identify criminal activity  <unk> 
not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and <unk>  <unk> 
as what happened when congress wanted to know about $ N toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost  <unk> 
mr. <unk> 's complaints simply wo n't wash  <unk> 
that the journal <unk> the <unk> fraud waste <unk> <unk> and abuse of the public that took place while mr. <unk> was secretary of hud etc. and so forth  <unk> 
to my mind the journal did not defend <unk> fraud waste <unk> <unk> and abuse of the public trust  <unk> 
defended appropriate constitutional <unk> and practical common sense  <unk> 
problem which the journal so <unk> pointed out in a number of articles is not the likes of mr. <unk> who after all is really a bit player on the stage but the attempt by congress to enhance itself into a <unk> body  <unk> 
course we 've also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective  <unk> 
system is the problem not an individual member  <unk> 
can always have their hands <unk>  <unk> 
's when such <unk> does n't occur that we 've got trouble  <unk> 
do not by any means defend hud management  <unk> 
i think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to american <unk> of liberty and freedom than any <unk> and yes maybe <unk> within hud could possibly generate  <unk> 
last time i saw a similar congressional hearing was when <unk> <unk> joe <unk> did his work  <unk> 
<unk>  <unk> 
n.j  <unk> 
disagree with the statement by mr. <unk> that one should not draw an adverse <unk> against former hud officials who <unk> their fifth amendment privilege against <unk> in congressional hearings  <unk> 
fifth amendment states in relevant part that no person shall be <unk> in any criminal case to be a witness against himself  <unk> 
privilege against <unk> <unk> the drawing of an adverse <unk> against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify  <unk> 
in a criminal case a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be <unk> to take the stand as a witness thus forcing him to take the fifth  <unk> 
privilege however has been limited in <unk> with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only  <unk> 
supreme court and some states have specifically recognized that the fifth amendment does not preclude the <unk> where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause  <unk> 
v. <unk> N u.s. N N  <unk> 
in a civil case a defendant may be called as a witness he may be forced to testify or take the fifth and his taking of the fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse <unk> against him in the civil matter  <unk> 
may take the fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and <unk> belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution  <unk> 
the defendant to take the fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony <unk> him in the civil matter but because the testimony in the civil matter could be <unk> used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution  <unk> 
the risk of such prosecution a court may order the defendant to testify  <unk> 
when mr. <unk> asserted the fifth in a <unk> proceeding particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel one must conclude that he held a <unk> <unk> belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution  <unk> 
subcommittee congress and the american public have every right to draw the adverse <unk> and to <unk> with mr. <unk> 's own belief that his testimony could help <unk> him of a crime  <unk> 
the adverse <unk> in a <unk> congressional hearing does not <unk> the fifth amendment shield against <unk>  <unk>

N p.m. tonight president bush must order $ N billion of automatic across-the-board cuts in government spending to comply with the gramm-rudman budget law  <unk>

N crash brought the reagan administration and democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ N billion even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ N billion during that period  <unk> 
barring further drops in the market this week a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year  <unk>

what about those of us whose views are not <unk> by formula or <unk>  <unk> 
should we think about national service  <unk> 
's begin by recognizing a main source of confusion national service has no agreed meaning  <unk> 
service be voluntary or <unk>  <unk> 
or long  <unk> 
or full-time  <unk> 
or unpaid  <unk> 
participants live at home and work nearby or live in <unk> and work on public <unk>  <unk> 
kinds of work would they do  <unk> 
does national mean  <unk> 
the program be run by the federal government by local governments or by private voluntary organizations  <unk> 
who would serve  <unk> 
males as with the draft or both <unk>  <unk> 
only or all ages  <unk> 
people or poor people or a genuine <unk>  <unk> 
or few  <unk> 
are not <unk> questions and the label national service answers none of them  <unk> 
how should we think about national service  <unk> 
a starting point here are five <unk> N consider the <unk> not the name  <unk> 
national service in the <unk> consider specific proposals  <unk> 
will differ in crucial ways  <unk> 
service should be service  <unk> 
commonly understood service implies sacrifice  <unk> 
involves accepting risk or giving up income or deferring a career  <unk> 
follows that proposals like <unk> whose benefits to <unk> are worth some $ N a year do not qualify  <unk> 
is a rationale for such bills federal subsidies to college students amount to a <unk> bill without the <unk> <unk> those benefits should be earned not given  <unk> 
the earnings exceed by N N the average income of young high-school graduates with full-time jobs  <unk> 
call that service  <unk> 
encouragement is fine <unk> is not  <unk> 
service is unconstitutional  <unk> 
is also <unk> and <unk>  <unk> 
will throw several hundred thousand <unk> in jail each year  <unk> 
through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior  <unk> 
should also encourage service <unk> by all classes and all ages  <unk> 
encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of <unk> in the u.s. should build on the service programs already in existence and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing  <unk> 
good programs are not cheap  <unk> 
assume that national service would get important work done <unk> forest fires fought housing <unk> students <unk> <unk> centers <unk>  <unk> 
is important work to be done and existing service and conservation corps have shown that even <unk> who start with few skills can do much of it well but not <unk>  <unk> 
service programs require <unk> <unk> training and supervision all of high quality  <unk> 
involve <unk> to participants  <unk> 
residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision they are particularly expensive more per participant than a year at stanford or yale  <unk> 
programs are cheaper but good ones still come to some $ N a year  <unk> 
they worth that  <unk> 
suggest that good ones are especially so if the effects on participants are counted  <unk> 
the calculations are <unk>  <unk> 
<unk> youth are a special concern  <unk> 
such expenditures <unk> then  <unk> 
if targeted  <unk> 
of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve but there are many ways for middle-class kids and their elders to serve at little public cost  <unk> 
can volunteer at any of thousands of <unk> institutions or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers  <unk> 
youth do n't have those opportunities  <unk> 
are not <unk> in high school or college  <unk> 
are unlikely to be employed  <unk> 
they have grown up in <unk> grim circumstances among family structures breaking down surrounded by <unk> <unk> and bleak prospects  <unk> 
many of them can be quite <unk> <unk> by productive and disciplined service  <unk> 
wo n't accept the discipline others drop out for other reasons  <unk> 
some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed  <unk> 
skills producing something <unk> feeling useful they are no longer dependent others now depend on them  <unk> 
if it is cheaper to build <unk> or <unk> apartments or plant <unk> with paid professionals the effects on the young people providing those services alter the <unk>  <unk>

are giving up no income deferring no careers <unk> no risk  <unk>
